title: Hello World!
---

Yes, I know, that wasn't very creative. But we are developers and I think you started coding with a simple "Hello World!" program in C, PHP, JAVA or another language. And, as this is my first post, I will name it like my first program too.

Now, some things about me. My name is Óscar Vicente Pérez and I'm from Spain. I started my journey in development three years ago with a Hello World! written in Java. Since that, I end my studies and worked half and a year with C# and .Net, Java, Php, and other languages and tecnologies.

I difference between coding and develop. I define coding as write code, lines of code. And define develop as all the other things such design, think, maintain a project/program. 

## What am I talk about in this blog?

Well, that's easy, about coding and develop. 

More deeply, I will post about two main things and extras:

### Development

> Which includes design patters and other things such Object-Oriented-Programming, good practices, etc...

When I talk about this things I meant every thing about development whose main objective is not coding. These will be the **long** ones and, of course, they will got code. They can explain the strategy pattern, introduce de IoC or talk about wrappers.

### Smart code

> Classes, tricks, smart algorithms, code. Things that you can reuse.

**Short/medium** posts explaining some smart answer to a problem. Like a double indexed map, how to implement a simple cache or a simple API to do something.

### Extras

Of course, the blog will have many post about curiosities, tips about everything or just things I found interesting. Sometimes can be as simply as some games to learn coding, a project on a raspberry, etc...
